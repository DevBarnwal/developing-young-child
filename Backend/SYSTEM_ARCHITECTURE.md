# SpacECE Digital Transformation Backend System Architecture

## Overview

The SpacECE Digital Transformation backend is a comprehensive API system designed to support early childhood development initiatives. This document provides a technical overview of the system architecture, components, data flow, and functionality.

## System Purpose

The system serves as the backend infrastructure for SpacECE's digital transformation initiative, providing:

1. **User Management**: Authentication, authorization, and profile management for parents, volunteers, and administrators
2. **Child Development Tracking**: Tools to monitor and assess child growth and developmental milestones
3. **Volunteer Visit Management**: Coordination and documentation of volunteer visits to children
4. **Educational Activity Management**: Repository of age-appropriate activities for child development
5. **Reporting & Analytics**: Data aggregation for insights into child development and program effectiveness

## Core Components

### 1. Authentication & Authorization System

The system implements a multi-layered security approach:

- **Authentication Methods**:

### 6. Reporting System

Data analysis and presentation layer:

- **Child-Centered Reports**:
  - Development progress over time
  - Milestone achievement tracking
  - Visit history and outcomes
  
- **Volunteer Performance Reports**:
  - Visit statistics and coverage
  - Activity implementation
  - Child progress under their guidance
  
- **Administrative Overview**:
  - System-wide analytics
  - Program effectiveness measures
  - Resource allocation insights

## Data Flow Architecture

### 1. User Interaction Flow

```
User Request → Authentication → Authorization → 
Controller Logic → Data Validation → Database Operation → 
Response Formatting → Client Response
```

### 2. Role-Based Data Access

- **Admin**: Full system access with management capabilities
- **Parent**: Access limited to own children's data and general activities
- **Volunteer**: Access limited to assigned children and visit management
- **User**: Limited access to their own data and public resources

### 3. Security Implementation

- JWT tokens for secure authentication
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Email verification for account validation
- Role-based middleware checks for protected routes
- Data segregation at the query level for privacy

## API Structure

The API follows RESTful principles with structured endpoints:

1. **Authentication Routes** (`/api/auth/*`):
   - User registration, login, and verification
   - OAuth provider integration
   - Session management
   
2. **User Routes** (`/api/users/*`):
   - User profile management
   - Role management
   - User lookup and filtering
   
3. **Child Routes** (`/api/children/*`):
   - Child profile management
   - Child data access and filtering
   
4. **Milestone Routes** (`/api/milestones/*`):
   - Milestone definition and tracking
   - Progress assessment and updates
   
5. **Visit Routes** (`/api/visits/*`):
   - Visit scheduling and documentation
   - Visit data retrieval and reporting
   
6. **Activity Routes** (`/api/activities/*`):
   - Activity template management
   - Age-appropriate activity retrieval
   
7. **Report Routes** (`/api/reports/*`):
   - Data aggregation and analysis
   - Formatted report generation

## Database Schema

The system uses MongoDB with the following key collections:

1. **Users Collection**:
   - Authentication data
   - Profile information (parent or volunteer)
   - Role and permission data
   
2. **Children Collection**:

   - Age-appropriate expectations
   - Assessment criteria
   - Progress tracking
   
4. **Visits Collection**:
   - Visit metadata (date, duration, location)
   - Activities conducted
   - Observations and assessments
   - Follow-up requirements
   
5. **Activities Collection**:
   - Age-appropriate activities
   - Domain categorization
   - Implementation instructions
